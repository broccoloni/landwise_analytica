        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Rainfall Patterns</h3>
        <p>Historical and projected rainfall distribution throughout the year. Quantified using an average mm/year compared to regional norms, plus a "rainfall reliability score" based on consistency.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Temperature Suitability</h3>
        <p>Alignment of temperature ranges with crop requirements. Could give a score based on how well the propertyâ€™s temperature range matches the optimal range for crops that exceed regional levels.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Growing Season Length</h3>
        <p>Number of frost-free or warm days suitable for growing crops. Quantifiable as the number of frost-free days compared to specific crop needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Climate Resilience</h3>
        <p>Climate projections (drought/flood risk in future decades) and proximity to mitigation features like nearby water bodies. Consider climate index scores that aggregate multiple risk factors.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="mb-4">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Flood Risk</h3>
        <p>Vulnerability of the land to seasonal flooding or waterlogging. Consider using floodplain data, proximity to water bodies, and drainage effectiveness to quantify risk as a percentage or a rating.</p>
